FAST-TRANSFORMERS (PARTIAL MIGRATION)
================================================================================

PACKAGE INFO
------------
Name:           pytorch-fast-transformers
Original URL:   https://github.com/idiap/fast-transformers
Version:        0.4.0 (Snapshot from Dec 2020)
License:        MIT License
Status:         FROZEN / PARTIAL SUBSET


MIGRATION CONTEXT
-----------------
This directory contains a stripped-down, pure-Python subset of the 
'fast-transformers' library. It was migrated into PerturbLab to support 
legacy weight compatibility for scGPT models while resolving critical build 
failures on modern environments.

This is NOT a full clone of the original repository.


RATIONALE FOR VENDORING
-----------------------
1.  Unmaintained Upstream: 
    The original library has seen no active development since 2020.

2.  Modern Compatibility:
    The original package fails to compile on PyTorch 2.x and CUDA 12.x due to 
    outdated C++ extension bindings.

3.  Build Isolation:
    PerturbLab aims to be easily installable via `pip`. The original package
    requires complex local compilation of CUDA kernels, which is a barrier 
    for many bioinformatics users.

4.  Specific Usage:
    scGPT primarily utilizes the `LinearAttention` mechanism, which can be 
    implemented using pure PyTorch operations (einsum) without requiring 
    custom CUDA kernels.


INCLUDED COMPONENTS (PURE PYTHON)
---------------------------------
Only the following components have been retained:

* core/           (Base interfaces)
* attention/      (LinearAttention logic using pure PyTorch)
* builders/       (TransformerEncoderBuilder)
* transformers/   (TransformerEncoder)
* masking/        (LengthMask)
* feature_maps/   (Kernel feature maps)
* events/         (Event dispatching system)

EXCLUDED COMPONENTS (REMOVED)
-----------------------------
All C++/CUDA extensions were removed to ensure portability:

* [REMOVED] causal_product (C++ extension)
* [REMOVED] local_product (C++ extension)
* [REMOVED] sparse_product (C++ extension)
* [REMOVED] aggregate (C++ extension)
* [REMOVED] clustering (C++ extension)
* [REMOVED] hashing (C++ extension)

NOTE: Do not attempt to re-add these files unless you plan to maintain 
custom CUDA kernels for PyTorch 2.x.


MAINTENANCE POLICY
------------------
This directory is treated as "Legacy/Frozen". 

* DO NOT apply feature updates here.
* DO NOT sync with upstream (upstream is dead).
* Only apply critical bug fixes if they directly affect scGPT inference.

For new model development, use:
1.  Flash Attention (flash-attn)
2.  PyTorch Native SDPA (Scaled Dot Product Attention)
3.  xFormers
